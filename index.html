<p>Crafting is vital to the PIB, as such many of the inmates gather junk items for the sole reason of crafting. Though not all inmates can craft at the same level as others.</p>
<h3>Please Note:</h3>
<li>The guide will be updated periodically, it may increase or decrease ingredients needed to craft items or introduce new items. Please pay attention to the changes. </li>

            
<h3>How to use:</h3>
<li>When your character scavenges using the Scavenging Guide (Link to the guide), the item you have collected will usually have a Basic Crafting Ingredient. These items, whilst usually pieces of junk with no real value, have a value as long as you can craft it into something else. The junk item may also be used in its base form.
For example: If you collect an empty glass bottle, you can use it either as glass or use the glass bottle for something else such as a molotov. </li>
<li>In order to be able to craft, both arms and hands must be intact, they cannot be broken.</li>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<li>Scavenging also provides your character tools, these tools can be used to make new items or convert existing Basic Crafting Ingredients into other Basic Crafting Ingredients.</li>
<li>For example: If you have cloth and a knife, you may strip the cloth into fiber. You may also use a wrench, saw and hammer to create a pipe gun as long as you have the expertise and materials.</li>

<h3>Crafting Level</h3>
<li>Crafting isn‚Äôt a skill that‚Äôs learnt overnight, your character will either have to craft items to level up or receive a book from a trader or reward. Knowledge Points (KP) will be assigned to each recipe, you receive the KP for crafting the item.</li>
<li>Crafting Level 1 Novice: 0-15 KP </li>
<li>Crafting Level 2 Intermediate: 15-60 KP</li>
<li>Crafting Level 3 Expert: 60-150 KP</li>

<h3>Unique Recipes</h3>
<li>Certain traders and missions will award unique recipes for the PIB to learn, these recipes can provide the necessary push for survival or to get rich. </li>

<h2>Basic Crafting Ingredients</h2>
<li>Basic Crafting Ingredients are the building blocks of crafting, you will need them to craft items or better crafting ingredients.</li>
<h3>Metal</h3>
<li>A hard, sturdy material used for making strong tools, weapons, and other items. Requires metallurgy tools to properly make use of (I.E., forge, cast, etc.)</li>
<h3>Wood</h3>
<li>A basic material used in the crafting of tools, weaponry, and other items. It can even be used to make shelter or traps. May require woodworking tools to properly make use of, but not necessarily.</li>
<h3>Adhesive</h3>
<li>Used to make sure objects stay together. Works best when used on objects of lighter weight.</li>
<h3>Fibers</h3>
<li>Threads of cloth that are used in sewing up clothing or tying items together.</li>
<h3>Pipe</h3>
<li>Pipes, used for pipe guns, handles and to beat people with.</li>
<h3>Cloth</h3>
<li>Raw pieces of fabric that can be used in the creation of clothing, goods, or even tools and weaponry.</li>
<h3>Blades</h3>
<li>Pieces of metal blades that can be used in the crafting of primarily weapons, but could also be used for tools and other goods. Good for cutting things.</li>
<h3>Screws and Nails</h3>
<li>Used in the crafting of tools, weapons, and other items to make sure materials stay together. Works better than adhesive - but maybe not as great for use on brittle objects.</li>
<h3>Plastic</h3>
<li>‚Ä¶Trash. Actual trash. Used in the crafting of items, or as a stand-alone item to help you hold objects or water depending on what you find.</li>
<h3>Glass</h3>
<li>Brittle and transparent; used in the crafting of objects, goods, or even weaponry. May require proper glassworking tools to make use of, but not necessarily.</li>
<h3>Stone</h3>
<li>A common material that can be used in the crafting of almost primitive tools, weapons, and other items early on. Could also be used as a weapon or tool on its own, if you have a big enough one.</li>
